## The message is sent two times or you're getting kicked when switching/writing in staffchat?
```
If you're on Velocity, you should add [SignedVelocity](https://modrinth.com/plugin/signedvelocity) to your velocity & 1.19+ paper servers.
If you're on BungeeCord or your issue is not fixed with the first method, you should look at the end of the config.yml.
```
